# Crypto
a bunch of ciphers that i made when I got bored, as well as a text to pixel simplifier


i wont explain too much as many bets and challenges ride on these ciphers but:
the original crypto is a really hard (impossible imo) cipher that uses time to encode text
notch uses the idea of a ratio to represent any decimal, which in turn can represent any data, like text
pycto condenses text into small pictures and vise versa, basically just base(# of diff chars in language) --> base(255^3)
simple1 is a variation of a ceasar cipher in a way that makes it much much harder
simple2 is honestly a realy bad design but makes the encoded text look very hard to decode
